# FREEcycle

Perfect platform to Give back to your Comunnity!

## Description

FOR any private individual, business, or other institution/entity WHO would like to provide or receive non-monetary donations, THE FREEcycle is a location-specific web-based social platform THAT allows users to create an account to post their own donations or message the author of other posts to receive items free of charge.
